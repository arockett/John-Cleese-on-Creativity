Transcript of <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb5oIIPO62g> which is uploaded by Video Arts, the copyright holder, so it should stay up.

Full runtime: approximately 37 minutes, including about a minute of preamble - the only important part, to me, is that this was recorded in January of 1991.

Comments in { } are _editorial_, intended to aid clarity of the written version.

Comments in ( ) are _original_, except for timestamps which are meant as a guide for those looking for a particular point in the video.

All headings are editorial, intended to aid in finding specific parts of the talk, as well as breaking up an otherwise lengthy block of text.

Bold/italics are intended to reflect tone of voice or when an especially important point was being made, but this is obviously somewhat subjective.

Footnotes were added basically as a reminder to myself of some interesting links I had found after watching this video.

I have tried to make this both readable and accurate. Sometimes what is spoken can be clear even if the words are out of order or omitted, but when reading it can be harder to understand.

It should be obvious that if you haven't *watched* the video, you should do that first, and then use the transcript later if you need to refer to a specific part or if you want to re-watch a particular segment again, which is why I have tried to include time codes at fairly regular intervals.

The `.srt` file is a subtitles file which can be used if you were to download the video somehow and play it back through something like VLC. How to do that is left as an exercise for the reader.

I hope that you will find this helpful.
